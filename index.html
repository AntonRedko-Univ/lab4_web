        <h1>Anteiku Cafe</h1>
        <p>This cafe is most likely the model of Tokyo Ghoul's Anteiku Cafe (あんていく).<br>
        It is conveniently located across the street from Nerima Station's South Exit.<br>
        Located on the 2nd floor, this old-fashioned cafe offers great street views.<br> 
        The coffee is very dense and tasty. The cafe owner spoke little English but was hospitable.<br> </p>

        <p>The cafe owner spoke little English but was hospitable. I came here during lunch time, and instead of ordering just a cup of coffee (370 yen), I ordered the curry rice lunch set with coffee (700 yen), which I thought was a good deal.
The only down side about this cafe is the tobacco smell.

        <p>The cafe will promote the live-action Tokyo Ghoul film, which will premiere on July 3 at Anime Expo in Los Angeles, July 7 in Berlin, and July 10 at the Marunouchi Piccadilly theater in Chiyoda, Japan before its wide theatrical release in Japan on July 29. Funimation has licensed the film and plans to release it theatrically in North America in Japanese with English subtitles. The film is planned to screen in 23 countries outside Japan. </p>

        <p>Recommendation: Tokyo Ghoul fans should come visit this place. If you follow the series (anime or manga), you will recognize this place as soon as you come in. However, I am not sure if the cafe owner knew about the series.

        <p>In the manga and anime, Anteiku is a neighborhood cafe operated by ghouls. In addition to maintaining its front as a cafe for humans, the shop also provides aid for ghouls in the area and helps maintain feeding for those who eat humans to survive. Protagonist Kaneki works at the cafe, where ghouls are only able to consume coffee. </p>
